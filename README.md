## Welcome

Welcome to the second week of the AML course!

This week, you will learn a few things about regression. Supervised Regression was simply called regression analysis before the AI gold rush. We use regression to study relationships among dependent and independent variables presented in data.

When these regression models are used for predicting, the regression analysis is categorized as supervised machine learning.

In this week's lecture, you will learn the following topics:

- **Simple linear regression** (single input, single output, linear relationship, deterministic)
- **Multiple linear regression** (multiple inputs, single output, linear relationship, deterministic)
- **Polynomial linear regression** (multiple inputs, single output, non-linear relationship, deterministic)
- **Logistic regression** (continuous inpu**t(s), binary output, deterministic)
- **Bayesian regression** (regression using stochastic process)

In between these specific regression topics, we will insert a few regression related topics. They are:

- **Regression metrics** (how to evaluate your regression model?)
- **Gradient descent algorithm** (how to perform optimization numerically?)
- **Bias variance trade-off** (why you model under-fits or over-fits?)
- **Regularization** (how to mitigate over-fitting problem?)

## Materials for the lecture

The lectures are split into 11 short videos (edited to approximately 10 minutes on average). Feel free to use 1.25x or 1.5x speed to watch. It will save you some time :)
Most topics are taught with the same dataset (about airplanes) that I have created for this lecture.

**[Important]**: Each course video is accompanied by a Python Jupyter notebook. You should download these notebooks before the start.
You can access and download the data and notebooks from the following GitHub repository:

## Survey

For student of CS4305TU class, it would be great if you can fill in the following survey when you have finished the lessons. This would be a great help for future improvement.
